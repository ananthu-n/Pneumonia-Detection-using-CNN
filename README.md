# Pneumonia-Detection-using-CNN
**Project Overview
**This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-ray images as either Pneumonia or Normal. The model is trained on a dataset of pediatric X-rays from the Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center. The goal is to develop an automated and accurate diagnostic system to assist medical professionals in detecting pneumonia from X-ray images.
